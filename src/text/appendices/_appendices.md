{numref}`Chapter %s (appendix)<apx:b>` gives two programs converting to and from clausal logic. The first program transforms a formula in first-order Predicate Logic to clausal form, as described in section 2.5. The second program completes a given set of general clauses by means of Predicate Completion (section 8.2). The output of this program is a formula in Predicate Logic, which can be transformed back to clausal form by means of the first program.

# Searching graphs #

````{exercise} ex:5.3
Consider the following program:
```Prolog
brother(peter,paul).
brother(adrian,paul).
brother(X,Y):-brother(Y,X).
brother(X,Y):-brother(X,Z),brother(Z,Y).
```
Compare and explain the behaviour of `prove_bf/1` and Prolog on the query `?-brother(peter,adrian)`. Can you re-order the clauses, such that Prolog succeeds?
````

Prolog will be trapped in an infinite loop, regardless of the order of the clauses. This is so because a refutation of `?-brother(peter,adrian)` requires both recursive clauses, but whichever is found first will also be tried before the second one in all the other refutation steps. In contrast, `prove_bf/1` will be able to construct a refutation.

````{exercise} ex:5.5
Give the models of the program
```Prolog
married(X);bachelor(X):-man(X),adult(X).
has_wife(X):-married(X),man(X).
man(paul).
adult(paul).
```
````

This program has four models (bachelors may have a wife, and married man may be bachelors):
```Prolog
{man(paul),adult(paul),bachelor(paul)}
{man(paul),adult(paul),bachelor(paul),has_wife(paul)}
{man(paul),adult(paul),married(paul),has_wife(paul)}
{man(paul),adult(paul),married(paul),bachelor(paul),
 has_wife(paul)}
```
The second and fourth models are non-minimal.

```{exercise} ex:5.6
Are all minimal models always constructed by `model/1`?
```

Yes. The set of all Herbrand interpretations can be seen as a search space, in which the models are to be found. This search space is ordered by the subset relation. `model/1` starts from the empty interpretation, and repeatedly adds ground atoms until a model is constructed. Since one atom is added at a time, the procedure will never jump over a model. Since, on backtracking, all possible ways to satisfy a violated clause are considered, `model/1` performs a breadth-first search (which is complete).

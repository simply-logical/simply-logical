Many (but not all) aspects of Artificial Intelligence are amenable to logical analysis. An early advocate of this approach is Kowalski (1979). Overviews of different types of logics used in Artificial Intelligence can be found in (Turner, 1984; Genesereth & Nilsson, 1987; Ramsay, 1988). Bl&auml;sius and B&uuml;rckert (1989) discuss more technical aspects of automated theorem proving.

The main source for theoretical results in Logic Programming is (Lloyd, 1987). Hogger (1990) gives a more accessible introduction to this theory. (Mendelson, 1987) is an excellent introduction to Predicate Logic.

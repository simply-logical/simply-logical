# Structured terms #

Finally, we illustrate the way Prolog can handle more complex datastructures, such as a list of stations representing a route. Suppose we want to redefine the reachability relation, such that it also specifies the intermediate stations. We could adapt the non-recursive definition of `reachable` as follows:
```Prolog
reachable0(X,Y):-connected(X,Y,L).
reachable1(X,Y,Z):-connected(X,Z,L1),
                   connected(Z,Y,L2).
reachable2(X,Y,Z1,Z2):-connected(X,Z1,L1),
                       connected(Z1,Z2,L2),
                       connected(Z2,Y,L3).
```
The suffix of reachable indicates the number of intermediate stations; it is added to stress that relations with different number of arguments are really different relations, even if their names are the same. The problem now is that we have to know the number of intermediate stations in advance, before we can ask the right query. This is, of course, unacceptable.

We can solve this problem by means of *functors*. A functor looks just like a mathematical function, but the important difference is that *functor expressions are never evaluated to determine a value*. Instead, they provide a way to name a complex object composed of simpler objects. For instance, a route with Oxford Circus and Tottenham Court Road as intermediate stations could be represented by
```Prolog
route(oxford_circus,tottenham_court_road)
```
Note that this is not a ground fact, but rather an argument for a logical formula. The reachability relation can now be defined as follows:
<!--This block originally inherited from 1.0.1 (`inherit-id: 1.0.1`), however since now the two are in different documents, the inheritance will not work and is replaced with `source-text-start`.-->
```{swish} 1.2.1
---
source-text-start: 1.0.1
---
```
<!--This block originally inherited from 1.0.1 (`inherit-id: 1.0.1`), however since now the two are in different documents, the inheritance will not work and is replaced with `source-text-start`.-->
```{swish} 1.2.2
---
source-text-start: 1.0.1
---
```
The query `?-reachable(oxford_circus,charing_cross,R)` now has three possible answers:
```text
{R→route(piccadilly_circus)}
{R→route(tottenham_court_road,leicester_square)}
{R→route(piccadilly_circus,leicester_square)}
```

As argued in the previous section, we prefer the recursive definition of the reachability relation, in which case we use functors in a somewhat different way.
<!--This block originally inherited from 1.0.1 (`inherit-id: 1.0.1`), however since now the two are in different documents, the inheritance will not work and is replaced with `source-text-start`.-->
```{swish} 1.2.2_2
---
source-text-start: 1.0.1
---
```
At first sight, there does not seem to be a big difference between this and the use of functors in the non-recursive program. However, the query
```Prolog
?-reachable(oxford_circus,charing_cross,R)
```
now has the following answers:
```Prolog
{R→route(tottenham_court_road,
         route(leicester_square,noroute))}
{R→route(piccadilly_circus,noroute)}
{R→route(piccadilly_circus,
         route(leicester_square,noroute))}
```
The functor `route` is now also recursive in nature: its first argument is a station, but *its second argument is again a route*. For instance, the object
```Prolog
route(tottenham_court_road,route(leicester_square,noroute))
```
can be pictured as in fig. 1.6. Such a figure is called a *tree* (we will have a lot more to say about trees in chapter 4). In order to find out the route represented by this complex object, we read the leaves of this tree from left to right, until we reach the 'terminator' `noroute`. This would result in a linear notation like
```Prolog
[tottenham_court_road,leicester_square].
```

```

For user-defined functors, such a linear notation is not available. However, Prolog provides a built-in 'datatype' called *lists*, for which both the tree-like notation and the linear notation may be used. The functor for lists is `.` (dot), which takes two arguments: the first element of the list (which may be any object), and the rest of the list (which must be a list). The list terminator is the special symbol `[]`, denoting the empty list. For instance, the term
```Prolog
.(a,.(b,.(c,[])))
```
denotes the list consisting of `a` followed by `b` followed by `c` (fig. 1.7). Alternatively, we may use the linear notation, which uses square brackets:
```Prolog
[a,b,c]
```
To increase readability of the tree-like notation, instead of
```Prolog
.(First,Rest)
```
one can also write
```Prolog
[First|Rest]
```
Note that `Rest` is a list: e.g., `[a,b,c]` is the same list as `[a|[b,c]]`. `a` is called the *head* of the list, and `[b,c]` is called its *tail*. Finally, to a certain extent the two notations can be mixed: at the head of the list, you can write any number of elements in linear notation. For instance,
```Prolog
[First,Second,Third|Rest]
```
denotes a list with three or more elements.

```{exercise} 1.4
A list is either the empty list `[]`, or a non-empty list `[First|Rest]` where `Rest` is a list. Define a relation `list(L)`, which checks whether `L` is a list. Adapt it such that it succeeds only for lists of (*i*) even length and (*ii*) odd length.
```

The recursive nature of such datastructures makes it possible to ignore the size of the objects, which is extremely useful in many situations. For instance, the definition of a route between two underground stations does not depend on the length of the route; all that matters is whether there is an intermediate station or not. For both cases, there is a clause. Expressing the route as a list, we can state the final definition of the reachability relation:
<!--This block originally inherited from 1.0.1 (`inherit-id: 1.0.1`), however since now the two are in different documents, the inheritance will not work and is replaced with `source-text-start`.-->
```{swish} 1.2.3
---
source-text-start: 1.0.1
---
```
The query `?-reachable(oxford_circus,charing_cross,R)` now results in the following answers:
```Prolog
{R→[tottenham_court_road,leicester_square]}
{R→[piccadilly_circus]}
{R→[piccadilly_circus,leicester_square]}
```
Note that Prolog writes out lists of fixed length in the linear notation.

Should we for some reason want to know from which station Charing Cross can be reached via a route with four intermediate stations, we should ask the query
```Prolog
?-reachable(X,charing_cross,[A,B,C,D])
```
which results in two answers:
```text
{ X→bond_street,A→green_park,B→oxford_circus,
  C→tottenham_court_road,D→leicester_square }
{ X→bond_street,A→green_park,B→oxford_circus,
  C→piccadilly_circus,D→leicester_square }.
```

# Trees as terms #

Recall from section 1.3 that complex Prolog terms like
```Prolog
route(tottenham_court_road,route(leicester_square,noroute))
```
can be viewed as a tree, with the functor `route` acting as the root of (sub)trees, and `tottenham_court_road`, `leicester_square`, and `noroute` as leaves ({numref}`fig:1.6`). Conversely, trees can be represented by Prolog terms.

```{exercise} 4.1
Draw the tree represented by the term `1(2(4),3(5,6))`.
```

A tree is traversed by first visiting its root, and then recursively traversing all of its subtrees. A list of subtrees is obtained by decomposing the complex term by means of the `=..` predicate (see section 3.7):
```{swish} 4.1.1
```
By means of these simple predicates, we can write a program for finding arcs and paths in a tree. Paths are represented as lists of nodes, and an arc is simply a path consisting of two nodes:

inherit-id: 4.1.1

title: Data abstraction
---
The principle of *data abstraction* prescribes to keep datastructures local to specific predicates such as `term_tree`, `term_root` and `term_subtree`, and to access the datastructures only through these predicates. The main advantage of this design principle is *modularity*: if we choose to change the representation of a tree, we just have to modify these specific predicates, but the predicates which call them need not be changed. In contrast, if we unfold `term_tree`, `term_root` and `term_subtree` into the definition of `term_arc`, we get the following piece of code:
```Prolog
term_arc(Tree,[Root,R]):-
    Tree=..[Root|Subtrees].
    element(Subtree,Subtrees),
    Subtree=..[R|S].
term_arc(Tree,Arc):-
    Tree=..[Root|Subtrees].
    element(Subtree,Subtrees),
    term_arc(Subtree,Arc).
```
This program fragment is badly designed, because `term_arc` explicitly mentions the way trees are represented by Prolog terms. Consequently, if we change this representation, `term_arc` needs to be changed as well. This illustrates that the design of good datastructures is as important in Prolog as it is in any other programming language.

````{exercise} 4.2
Give a term `Tree`, such that it contains the tree of exercise 4.1, and such that `Path=[1,2,7,8]` is an answer to the query
```Prolog
?-term_path(Tree,Path).
```

Which are the paths through this tree?

Consider the tree in {numref}`fig:4.2`. The following query lists all the paths in this tree:
```Prolog
?-term_path(n1(n2(n4,n5(n7),n6),n3(n8,n9(n10))),Path).
  Path = [1,2];
  Path = [1,3];
  Path = [2,4];
  Path = [2,5];
  Path = [2,6];
  Path = [5,7];
  Path = [3,8];
  Path = [3,9];
  Path = [9,10];
  Path = [1,2,4];
  Path = [1,2,5];
  Path = [1,2,6];
  Path = [1,2,5,7];
  Path = [1,3,8];
  Path = [1,3,9];
  Path = [1,3,9,10];
  Path = [2,5,7];
  Path = [3,9,10];
  No more solutions
```

```{exercise} 4.3
Explain the order in which these paths are found.
```

It would be convenient to have a program for printing Prolog terms which represent trees in a tree-like way. The nicest way to do this is to print from the root down; however, this requires a rather elaborate program[^13]. A reasonable alternative is to print the tree rotated at 90 degrees, from the root to the right. A program to do this is given below.
```{swish} 4.1.3
---
inherit-id: 4.1.1
---
```
`name/2`[^14] is a built-in predicate, converting an atom into a list of ASCII-codes. In combination with `length/2`, it is used to determine the number of characters in an atom. The query `?-term_write(1(2(4,5(7),6),3(8,9(10))))` displays the tree as follows:
```Prolog
---------1---------2---------4
                    ---------5---------7
                    ---------6
          ---------3---------8
                    ---------9--------10
```

[^13]: Such a program should perform breadth-first search; see Exercise 5.2.
[^14]: From now on, we denote a `Predicate` with `Arity` as `Predicate/Arity`. This is because predicates with different arity are different predicates, even if they share the same predicate name.

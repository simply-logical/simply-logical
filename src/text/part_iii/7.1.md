### 7.1 Grammars and parsing ###

The syntax of a language is specified by a *grammar*, which is a set of *grammar rules* of the form
```Prolog
Category1 --> Category2,Category3
Category2 --> [Terminal]
```
Here, `CategoryX` denotes a *syntactic category*, specifying the type of a sentence part (e.g. noun, noun phrase, etc.). The first rule states that a `Category2` followed by a `Category3` is a `Category1`. For instance, the fact that a sentence may consist of a noun phrase followed by a verb phrase is expressed by the rule
```Prolog
sentence --> noun_phrase,verb_phrase
```
A *terminal* is any word which occurs in the language. The second rule above assigns a syntactic category to a word. For instance:
```Prolog
noun --> [bicycle]
```
Syntactic categories are also called *non-terminals*.

A grammar which specifies a tiny bit of the English language is given below. As in clausal logic, grammar rules are separated by periods.
```{swish} 7.1.1
```
Some sentences generated by this grammar are: &lsquo;the lazy turtle sleeps&rsquo;, &lsquo;Achilles beats the turtle&rsquo;, and &lsquo;the rapid turtle beats Achilles&rsquo;. The grammatical structure of these sentences can be described by a *parse tree*, which is a tree containing the words of the sentence as leaves, and the syntactic categories assigned to parts of the sentence as nodes (fig. 7.1).

Parse tree for the sentence &lsquo;the rapid turtle beats Achilles&rsquo;.
```

```{exercise} 7.1
Redraw this parse tree in the manner of an SLD proof tree, where &lsquo;resolvents&rsquo; are partially parsed sentences such as
  ```Prolog
  [the],[rapid],noun,verb_phrase
  ```
and &lsquo;clauses&rsquo; are grammar rules.
```

Such a parse tree can be constructed by starting with the non-terminal `sentence`, and repeatedly replacing non-terminals by the righthand side of an applicable rule, until the given sentence is obtained as a sequence of terminals. This method is called *top-down parsing*. Alternatively, we could start with the sentence and look for parts of it which occur on the righthand side of a rule, and replace that part of the sentence with the non-terminal on the lefthand side of the rule, until we obtain the single non-terminal `sentence`. This procedure is called *bottom-up parsing*. It should be noted that both methods require search: at any stage, several rules might be applicable.

```{exercise} 7.2
Draw the search space generated by the above grammar for a top-down parse, if grammar rules are applied to sentences from left to right. Discuss the similarities and differences with SLD-trees.
```

In general, grammar rules are allowed to be recursive. For instance, a noun phrase can contain several adjectives, as described by the following rules:
```{swish} 7.1.2
```
This set of rules allows &lsquo;the lazy rapid turtle&rsquo; as a noun phrase. Recursion extends the descriptive power of a grammar considerably, by allowing repetitive structures.

Grammars like the ones we have seen are called *context-free grammars*. This name derives from the fact that only one non-terminal is allowed on the left of a grammar rule. A grammar rule which contains several non-terminals on its lefthand side is called *context-sensitive*: some of those non-terminals act as a *context* for the others, allowing the rule to be used only when that context is present. As an example, consider a grammar which would rule out sentences like &lsquo;the turtles sleeps&rsquo;, in which the &lsquo;plurality&rsquo; (singular, plural) of noun and verb disagree. A candidate would be:
```{swish} 7.1.3
```
In this grammar, the non-terminal `plurality` creates a context for the applicability of the rewrite rules for noun and intransitive verb. Procedural programming languages like Pascal are also, to some extent, context-sensitive: statements like `X:=10` can only be parsed in the context created by the declaration of the variable `X` (if it is declared to be a Boolean, the statement is illegal). Apart from this, such programming languages are context-free: each statement can be parsed without referring to its context.

Context-sensitive grammars greatly increase the complexity of the parsing task; moreover, the grammatical structure of sentences cannot be simply described by a parse tree. In this chapter, we will restrict attention to context-free grammars, extended with some Prolog-specific features. The resulting grammars are called *Definite Clause Grammars*, and will be introduced in the next section.
